# Informed-Searches
Artificial Intelligence Informed Searches are Implemented in Java
# Algorithms implemented are
1) Best First Search
2) A* Search.
3) Iterative A* Search.
>These algorithm are solving the problem stated in **Problem Statement.pdf**

>Kindly read the problem stated that may help you to understand the codes.
# To run the .jar file  (Executable JAR file)
1) Download the algo.jar file in exe folder and grid.txt file
2) Keep the .JAR file and grid.txt file in same folder
3) Change the directory to the folder where both files (.JAR and grid.txt) are placed.
4) Enter this command
	      java -jar algo.jar
5) Program will execute
# Code Reading Guide
1) All algortihms (.java classes) are inherited from **SearchingAlgorithm.java**
2) These searches are for graph based State Space.
3) To add other Search you have to inherit it from **SearchingAlgorithm.java**
